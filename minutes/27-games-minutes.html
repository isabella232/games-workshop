        Babylon.js)</h3>
        <p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> I ♥ the Web - I created
        babylon.js, which is used by many to build other projects, an
        idea I ♥<br />
        ... We used to have Flash games, and Flash died, for the
        better<br />
        ... Web on games have improved a lot since then<br />
        ... I've been able to play Minecraft in my browser<br />
        ... we did wonders!<br />
        ... I ♥ the Web, but it also drives me crazy<br />
        ... it has so many limitations<br />
        ... lots of my friends use native tools, such as Unity,
        Unreal<br />
        ... they have access to so many tools and toys, I'm jealous of
        them<br />
        ... The agenda will cover many of the problems faced by game
        developers on the Web<br />
        ... one of them is Asset Management - in particular the extent
        to which they get made available without protection<br />
        ... Performance is a core of the business of my tool<br />
        ... Cloud support is another important direction the industry
        is going to<br />
        ... IP protection, file size, compression, Web GPU, threading,
        Web Assembly, new codecs, gamepad support<br />
        ... A lot of interesting topics to discuss - let's change the
        Web together<br />
        ... We can make it better<br />
        ... I'm impressed by the many organizations in the room,
        including many that are otherwise competitors<br />
        ... We're all friends today, with a shared goal</p>


        <h3 id="session-context">Setting the context: Web games development</h3>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Francois:</cite> this session is about
        feedback from developers of building games on the Web, from
        different perspectives, starting with Chris from Facebook
        Instant Games</p>

        <h4 id="item02">Instant Games developer feedback</h4>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Chris:</cite> I work as an engineer at
        Facebook around Instant Games, helping developers to build
        games for our platform<br />
        ... Instant Games is where we are at now<br />
        ... I'm here to listen and learn but wanted to highlight some of
        the perspectives we've heard<br />
        ... first, introducing Instant Games<br />
        ... Instant Games is an HTML5 games platform running in a
        WebView<br />
        ... The WebView is responsible for the game, where the Facebook
        app deals with platform integration (e.g. authentication, ads,
        etc)<br />
        ... WebView handles all the graphics, input, audio<br />
        ... the games get hosted on our CDNs<br />
        ... there are 2 sets of problems that we have: some are purely
        on us, e.g. monetization, social gaming (for which we're very
        well positioned as a social network), and keep the platform
        trustworthy<br />
        ... but some problems we need help with: getting high fidelity
        games is challenging due to restrictions,<br />
        ... battery life and temperature are problematic<br />
        ... esp. in lower end devices<br />
        ... and finally, the need to protect games asset<br />
        ... It's great that the Web is such an open platform, but it
        isn't great when it means developers get ripped off of their
        assets<br />
        ... Some specific issues from Instant Games developers: device
        capabilities detection; getting out of memory is particularly
        problematic since it crashes not only the game, but also the
        Facebook app<br />
        ... we see higher rate of crashes when Instant Games are in
        use<br />
        ... Another issue is having webviews at feature parity with
        browsers<br />
        ... and IP protection for Games developers<br />
        ... Caching and loading - delay in getting a game starting has
        a strong impact on engagement<br />
        ... And WebAssembly is an important element of changes</p>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Bernard:</cite> about asset protection -
        what are the key thing you're looking to protect?</p>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Chris:</cite> people basically clone
        some games, re-upload them with ads<br />
        ... the first level of protection would to be avoid cloning
        whole games<br />
        ... next level might be protecting specific 3D assets, but
        getting the first level done would already go a long way</p>
        
        <h4 id="item03">Report from the trenches of an HTML5 game
        provider</h4>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Christian:</cite> Christian Rudnick, CTO,
        Softgames<br />
        ... We want to
        share our challenges as a game developer and publisher<br />
        ... We all know challenges of loading and storage<br />
        ... platform should deliver first bits within second<br />
        ... challenging but it's quite hard to get there<br />
        ... casual game developers tend to load everything up
        front<br />
        ... don't think about background loading, so it's hard to
        achieve 3 seconds<br />
        ... when games are more valuable, meta, graphics, etc.<br />
        ... one of the issues we have<br />
        ... The loading and storage leads to issue of offline
        play<br />
        ... native games<br />
        ... once loaded on your mobile phone, you can play it
        everywhere<br />
        ... web game not so much<br />
        ... conflict between fast loading a good game and @
        preparation<br />
        ... what about games with monetization?<br />
        ... how to present for offline?<br />
        ... I very much like what Google did for search engine, provide
        mini-game<br />
        ... in afternoon there will be a session on loading and
        storage<br />
        ... I will attend and see what we can do<br />
        ... we also have issue of piracy<br />
        ... we make it easy to steal the game; there is no way to
        protect our games on the web<br />
        ... there are tools to make them beautiful and de-obfuscate
        it<br />
        ... when it comes to older games<br />
        ... we only have the code anymore<br />
        ... one of ideas was 'runtime code'<br />
        ... deliver a web service<br />
        ... we have another problem<br />
        ... for now we gave up; not really a chance<br />
        ... one you get your user playing a game<br />
        ... maybe stealing as well, there is an issue of multiple
        devices<br />
        ... we played with finger printing the user<br />
        ... mobile devices...no way for 100% hit rate<br />
        ... and that is insufficient<br />
        ... you get user, we want to get millions of users<br />
        ... then it comes to problem of discovery<br />
        ... my colleague will talk about this now</p>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Gili:</cite> Gili Zeevi. I will talk about
        discovery<br />
        ... in past had choice of talking about discovery in web
        games<br />
        ... there are tons of games on the web<br />
        ... it is a challenge to push traffic on these games<br />
        ... this would continue to be challenging for us<br />
        ... also a challenge to get a player to play again, the
        retention<br />
        ... some effects in native<br />
        ... push notifications<br />
        ... opt-in rate<br />
        ... push notification and ability to engage users and get back
        to game<br />
        ... like to have opt-in when user accepts notification<br />
        ... this is not solved in the best way for the user
        experience<br />
        ... in some cases users may not be aware they can opt in<br />
        ... Chrome solved it better; maybe direction to go in where
        user acknowledges it<br />
        ... Maybe look at shortcuts and bookmarks<br />
        ... users might not be aware they can add to the home
        screen<br />
        ... having opportunity to show something like the notification
        would be a good thing<br />
        ... enter the game consistently<br />
        ... on FB instant games we can create these shortcuts<br />
        ... and we see users doing it and their retention is
        significantly higher<br />
        ... Monetization<br />
        ... we create games for fun but also to make money<br />
        ... the revenue is 60 billion on native, like to see same on web
        games<br />
        ... making API standard, make experience...users to trust this
        kind of feature<br />
        ... do it the same way as native<br />
        ... but have a solid solution for rewarded ads<br />
        ... huge opp for monetization<br />
        ... that is a summary of our major issues and challenges<br />
        ... not everything as Christian said<br />
        ... and looking forward to tackling these things during this
        workshop</p>

        <p class='phone'>Gili: A way for a user to watch and ad and get
        rewarded to replay a level by watching the ad for example</p>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Francois:</cite> Why is game stealing specific to the web<br />
        ... what makes piracy more problematic on the Web?</p>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Christian:</cite> you can crack the
        code<br />
        ... store on local browser</p>

        ... we will go into details later; we are currently setting the
        context during these talks<br />

        tomorrow</p>

        <h4 id="item04">Indie Perspective on Web Games</h4>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Andrzej:</cite> Andrzej Mazur. I am excited to be
        here<br />
        ... this is my own experience<br />
        ... you can call me Ender<br />
        ... I am founder of Enclave Games<br />
        ... huge team of me and my wife<br />
        ... also curator of JS13K Games competition<br />
        ... we do meet-ups<br />
        ... and also with Gamesdev.js<br />
        ... thank you W3C for inviting me, and Mozilla for sending me
        here<br />
        ... progressive web apps<br />
        ... I want to start by going back to 2011<br />
        ... wayback machine<br />
        ... there was a W3C workshop in Warsaw that sparked cool
        conversations<br />
        ... it made me prepare a presentation for a conference in
        2012<br />
        ... and I wondered if it was possible to create HTML
        games<br />
        ... it was a struggle<br />
        ... it was really hard, very challenging<br />
        ... the performance was not the best, to say the least<br />
        ... most of the games<br />
        ... just did not work<br />
        ... we could not fight with all the features<br />
        ... working offline was only in theory; did not work too well
        in practice<br />
        ... there were not many APIs, just drafts<br />
        ... cutting edge, but not working well<br />
        ... very experimental; play with a gamepad<br />
        ... hard to have pointer lock and fullscreen<br />
        ... hard to build with that technology<br />
        ... it was also hard because there were not many tools<br />
        ... I remember the first games I was building JQuery<br />
        ... many front-end developers used tools they already
        knew<br />
        ... Monetization was non-existant<br />
        ... it was a topic that we were building games for fun and
        seeing if it was technically possible<br />
        ... not many developers were thinking about having a business
        around that<br />
        ... Good news is that most of the stuff in 2019 now works<br />
        ... you don't have to be a developer to create games<br />
        ... it's not about struggling with the tech; I can build a
        game<br />
        ... but main question is what is next<br />
        ... I built the game, so what now?<br />
        ... We still have discussions comparing web to native<br />
        ... you can choose native, even though you are building with
        open web technologies<br />
        ... but you are competing with developers using native
        tools<br />
        ... they have more years of experience<br />
        ... and forgetting about important features; the URL<br />
        ... you can stay with web<br />
        ... instead of going native<br />
        ... work with publishers and platforms<br />
        ... work with publishers<br />
        ... development focus is on the mobile web right now more<br />
        ... that is where most of traffic is going<br />
        ... developers are finding progressive web apps to be
        useful<br />
        ... you can load assets after the initial load, etc.<br />
        ... you can also distinct single devs vs small and bigger
        studios<br />
        ... small indies usually create hyper-casual experiences that
        you can play on the toilet or commuting to work<br />
        ... bigger studies push the boundaries<br />
        ... IndieDevs are looking into the new technologies<br />
        ... it is easy to build hyper-casuals<br />
        ... but maybe it will be easy to use WebXR in future<br />
        ... and is there a way to monetize it<br />
        ... how do you show the games to the public?<br />
        ... these are things I see in the community<br />
        ... but I also decided to ask the community and get their
        feedback; what are their struggles?<br />
        ... Interesting to see that we don't have a specific big issue
        any more<br />
        ... rather it's a whole lot of small things<br />
        ... things like we have too many packages, should I package it
        with a grant or @<br />
        ... too many things to choose from<br />
        ... we need tools to debug the games<br />
        ... be nice to debug Canvas<br />
        ... with devtools or something<br />
        ... we need more materials<br />
        ... there is information on the web<br />
        ... video tutorials<br />
        ... about the different technologies, but we need more<br />
        ... also situation with new platforms<br />
        ... you can build games quickly<br />
        ... but developers are not getting support from the platform or
        the publishers<br />
        ... reaching to send games to the platform<br />
        ... when there are so many games submitted, it is hard to get
        feedback, hard to get updates<br />
        ... wait a month or more<br />
        ... something we could actively work on<br />
        ... Also more technical questions in this survey<br />
        ... can we have native 2D and 3D math modules?<br />
        ... they could be built into the browser<br />
        ... what about shared array buffers<br />
        ... can we get back to SAB; is it safe?<br />
        ... two more important things mentioned that you also saw on
        the other two presentations is discoverability and
        monetization<br />
        ... Going back to 2011<br />
        ... I built a game<br />
        ... about shooting to IE6<br />
        ... it was interesting to see that the game was built only for
        the conference; I published it on my blog<br />
        ... then it started to appear on other sites</p>
        <p class='phone'>[reads funny headlines]</p>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Andrzej:</cite> there were 50 articles
        and they just copy/pasted<br />
        ... make a game and someone would copy it and it would be
        everywhere<br />
        ... a few years later<br />
        ... some developers are making 500 games<br />
        ... and have hundreds or thousands of developers like
        these<br />
        ... super easy to create an HTML5 game today<br />
        ... in a week for a hyper-casual game<br />
        ... easy to look at game and make the same one in just a few
        days<br />
        ... securing the source code is important<br />
        ... but working with publishers and platforms to track down
        stolen games and not wait three months to take it down is
        important<br />
        ... So discoverability is one things and also
        monetization<br />
        ... We had a thing were developers were selling licenses to
        publishers<br />
        ... fixed fee<br />
        ... worked nice<br />
        ... and over the years it evolved into the subscription
        model<br />
        ... paid a small fee to publish game every month<br />
        ... Now most popular approach is revenue share<br />
        ... and split earnings out of the advertisements<br />
        ... it is hard to predict this<br />
        ... not as good for developers<br />
        ... fixed fee I knew how many licenses I could sell<br />
        ... with revenue share<br />
        ... it was like, 'ok, we have tens of billions of users' but
        game earned $1 per month<br />
        ... and you cannot live off of that<br />
        ... developers were free-lancing<br />
        ... revenue share is really tricky<br />
        ... of course every publisher and platform will show a specific
        success story of developer X<br />
        ... but most of the developers are struggling to make a living
        making games<br />
        ... hard to focus only the games and make money<br />
        ... I mentioned that protecting the source code and assets is
        important<br />
        ... but having an ordinary clone of your game taken down is
        also important<br />
        ... from the developer point of view<br />
        ... to fight with such things<br />
        ... To summarize<br />
        ... the technology is good enough, compared especially to a few
        years ago<br />
        ... no big issues, but a lot of small issues we can work
        on<br />
        ... Discoverability is definitely a problem<br />
        ... with so many games, it's hard to stand out, and be visible
        with your games<br />
        ... harder and hard to have a business around making
        hyper-casual games<br />
        ... have to find other opportunities to make money<br />
        ... those are the most important things from the IndieDev
        perspective<br />

        <p class='phone'><cite>Bjorn:</cite> from Stockholm office at KING, will talk about debugging <br>
        ... our game engine and how to debug html5 apps <br>
        ... King has released 200 games over the year, starting from Flash to facebook and mobile games <br>
        ... in the app stores <br>
        ... the most popular one is Candy Crush <br>
        ... 268 000 000 users <br>
        ... 2 game engines at King - one of them is Defold <br>
        ... Defold is a game engine and editor, cross-platform <br>
        ... published to native on mobile, desktop apps and HTML5 <br>
        ... it's a C engine, with Lua for game logic <br>
        ... 3D with 2D focus <br>
        ... component based, small and modular <br>
        ... used in Google Play Instant, Facebook Instant Games, playable ads <br>
        ... Defold was released for free in GDC 2016, available to anyone <br>
        ... with an organically growing active community of develoeprs <br>
        ... couple of King games released with it <br>
        ... and a few major indie games built on it as well <br>
        ... Our C++ engine is completed by a bunch of platform specific code to adapt to each target <br>
        ... JS for HTML5 - the ratio between shared and platform-specific is around 20:1 <br>
        ... debugging is a must; usually enough to debug on host platform <br>
        ... but what about HTML5-specific problems? these require a different set of tools <br>
        ... the game engine is transpiled to JS with emscripten <br>
        ... we use Web Assembly with source maps that help with debugging <br>
        ... that's nice, but coming from our background of C developers, we would prefer to use our existing debugging tools in this context too <br>
        ... How do you debug problems specific with Web Assembly? <br>
        ... Debugging graphics is also important for us <br>
        ... we would like to be able to inspect the textures uploaded to the GPU, shaders, draw calls, composition <br>
        ... we use WebGL and OpenGL <br>
        ... on desktop and mobile we get powerful tools (renderdoc) <br>
        ... but what about WebGL? we have spector.js which is great, but can we get better integrated support in browser dev tools?

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> with my babylon.js hat on, I'm going to write my letter to Santa Claus.<br>
        ... today, doing Multithread on the Web is done with a very process-oriented way <br>
        ... it's tough to compete with native when you can't use multi-threading across multiple cores <br>
        ... Why isn't web workers enough? they're not easy to work with <br>
        ... in a 3D engine, we have lots of things to do in // <br>
        ... Frustum culling can be done in // - but in a Web workers, this requires copying and passing with serialization <br>
        ... Lacking a shared memory structure is a big gap for the Web <br>
        ... this would apply likewise for particles <br>
        ... many of my colleagues (e.g. at SharePoint) would love this as well <br>
        ... a better threading support would go a long way <br>
        ... Web workers can't run a worker in the same context - it has to be run in separate file, communicating with string based messages <br>
        ... the only thing they can work with ArrayBuffers - they work like processes more than thread <br>
        ... here is a my santa claus wishlist <br>
        ... Could we have a PromiseTask that would run a different thread? <br>
        ... Feedback from the MS browser team was that it wasn't easy or possible <br>
        ... including some friction from TC39 <br>
        ... JS engines are optimized for thread isolation <br>
        ... this means changing this would be complicated <br>
        ... Apple experimented this two years ago - not sure where this has gone <br>
        ... Assuming my PromiseTask can't work, can we at least improve Web workers? <br>
        ... allow to share structure objects would go a long way <br>
        ... let's extend the idea of SharedArrayBuffer with a SharedObjectGraph that could only be spinned from Web workers <br>
        ... that would allow 3D engines to run on a specific thread that would spawn new workers without touching the main thread <br>
        ... with OffscreenCanvas, this would work well <br>
        ... this would leave DOM &amp; WebGL access out of scope, but still removes a lot of the serialization cost <br>
        ... Again, it makes no sense to have this requirement to keep Web workers defined in a separate file <br>
        ... Let's discuss - these needs matter for games, but not just for games <br>
        ... any kind of expensive experience on the Web will need that <br>
        ... audio, input, etc <br>
        ... my Word colleagues would love to use separate thread for spell checking
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Nell:</cite> would this PromiseTask be callable only from Workers, or also main threads? <br>
        ... how would the timing work?
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> this idea is inspired from C# <br>
        ... Promises have already synchronization semantics <br>
        ... the main thread would wait till the resolution of the PromiseTask, stalling the main thread
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Nell:</cite> so a PromiseTask would be different from a Promise <br>
        ... the main thread would be blocked, and only the PromiseTasks would be executed during that
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> correct
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Nell:</cite> my worry is what happens with queued operations (events, promises)
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> I don't want to block the main thread <br>
        ... the continuation of the PromiseTask would happen in the main thread <br>
        ... the continuation would be queued in the task queue of the main thread
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Ricardo_ThreeJS:</cite> I'm not a browser person - I'm on your side :) <br>

        <cite>Will_Google:</cite> one model that might help overcoming some of the negative pushback from browser devs might be to use read-only memory [?]
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> the problem is the cost of serialization <br>
        ... I want to be able to run things in parallel, wait until all the threads are done, and then render <br>
        ... and to avoid blocking the main thread, this would happen in a dedicated Web workers
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David_Playcanvas:</cite> sharedarraybuffer in Web workers has been disabled due to Spectre <br>
        ... if that existed or some equivalent, or had the ability to have Web workers not in a separate file - would that resolve the problem?
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> with SharedArrayBuffers, I lose the structure of my objects <br>
        ... that's not much an issue in Web Assembly, but for JS libraries, this require serialization/deserialization <br>
        ... we could use index in a sharedarraybuffer, but then our API has to be slower to map between that index and the exposed property to the developer <br>
        ... keeping a sharedarraybuffer synchronized will cost a lot in performance <br>
        ... TransferableObjects allow sharing objects across workers - could we extend this to fit this?
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David_Playcanvas:</cite> I see how that would help
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Andrew_Mozilla:</cite> my understanding is that we've reached consensus with other browsers to let pages opt-in to SharedArrayBuffer by disabling cors <br>
        ... so sharedarraybuffer should be coming back soon <br>
        ... the problem with multiple threads is that it changes the execution model and creates reentrancy issues <br>
        ... I agree the problem of serialization is real <br>
        ... but having shared JS objects would go against JIT magic and wouldn't work with multiple globals
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>David:</cite> I agree these are hard problems <br>

        ... asm.js emerged out the desire to make the resulting code run smoothly <br>
        ... it started gaining adoption in lots of game platforms <br>
        ... this made it clear there was a need that could be addressed with more collaboration <br>
        ... which lead to the emergence of Web Assembly <br>
        ... in 2017, we shipped the initial version of Web Assembly in 4 browsers, just 2 years after the creation of the Web Assembly CG <br>
        ... right after that, we started looking at what we should add <br>
        ... we took inspiration from the TC39 stages process (from early idea to shipped feature) <br>

        ... in the Web Assembly MVP, there are basically 4 types: 2 integer types, and 2 float types <br>

        ... basically refining reference types to make binding to WebIDL APIs more efficient <br>
        ... since we can focus on a well-defined subsets of types <br>
        ... [in the mvp slide] <br>
        ... Currently, in the MVP, calling a Web APIs require lots of conversions and glue (WASM -&gt; JS, JS -&gt; WebIDL, WebIDL-&gt;C++), creating costs and complexity <br>
        ... With WebIDL bindings, we will simplify this greatly, making it possible to program and extend how the conversions happen in and out of the Web IDL Bindings wrapper using a set of defined operators <br>
        ... We have an explainer that details this proposal <br>
        ... [Binding Types/Values sketch] <br>

        ... [Beinding Expressions sampler] <br>

        ... likewise, a record (Dictionary in WebIDL) can be represented in multiple ways <br>
        ... these operators can be composed together <br>
        ... We want direct access to WebIDL from WASM - what do we mean by that? <br>
        ... this means both when importing WASM code, and when calling it <br>
        ... currently, you need some JS code to expose Web APIs to WASM <br>
        ... likewise, lots of glue code needed when calling code <br>
        ... WebIDL binding would help when calling code <br>
        ... the importing facing will be managed by separate proposals: WebAssembly ESM-integration and Built-in modules and import-maps <br>
        ... and get-originals which expose Web APIs as built-in modules <br>

        ... there is potential for further collaboration between the
        two orgs<br />
        ... I want to highlight a few of our standards, 3D is what we

        WebGL<br />
        ... SPIR is a a graphic shader and could be useful for
        WebGPU<br />
        ... we have OpenXR which is around VR and AR, need to
        coordinate with Nell on WebXR<br />
        ... reason we are here is to discuss glTF<br />
        ... all the media types had the equivalent of JPEG, small,
        compact and supported by most platforms<br />
        ... we make it independent from runtime, it is open and
        extensible. WebGL was the first use case<br />
        ... glTF has support from Microsoft, it is more than glsl for
        shaders<br />
        ... this is a glTF model running within PowerPoint<br />
        ... we have had astounding levels of adoption (slide of
        implementer logos)<br />

        engines. you can post a glTF picture on Facebook<br />

        ... people always want more functionality. we were constantly
        balancing functionality with desire to keep the spec
        simplistic<br />

        <h4 id="item13">Browser Storage, Andrew Sutherland,
        Mozilla</h4>
        <p class='phone'><cite>Andrew:</cite> I am Andrew Sutherland, I work at Mozilla on the DOM Team, specifically the Workers and Storage sub team that is dealing with service workers as well as the workers that do not do what people want right now and all of the related storage APIs.<br/>
    ... I wanna go over what our current, the Cross-Browser Storage API story is. There obviously exits Web SQL Database which we will not speak of further.<br/>
    ... We have number one, cookies. It's a synchronous storage API, it stores only strings and there's a Hard Storage Cap. The cap is in fact so hard that if you try and use too many cookies on your domain, we'll just start evicting them. So you really don't want to be using this for game storage at all, only for network authentication and such.<br/>
    ... Next, we have LocalStorage which is a synchronous API as well. Also only stores strings, also Hard Storage Cap. Five megabytes, I think is pretty much the universal cap and it has the interesting wrinkle that at least for legacy purposes in Firefox, it's shared among your entire eTLD+1, e.g. for example.com if you have foo.example.com and bar.example.com, you're all sharing a five megabyte limit which has caused problems for sites like Wikipedia that tried to cache their JavaScript there and because Wikipedia shards by language, they ended up running out of quota so that on some languages, you wouldn't have any storage accessible at all.<br/>
    ... LocalStorage is also interesting because if you go to access LocalStorage when your site is loading and we don't already have the data available, we are effectively compelled to block the main thread until we have the data available. Which means that we've also optimized it a lot. I would recommend, if you're really concerned about time to interactive, LocalStorage might not be a bad thing to use but you need to be careful and coordinate with other people on your origin...<br/>
    ... I think a very common thing we see is sites will have a auto-appending log, like it's fun to gather telemetry and such but people will just constantly write to LocalStorage with additional, like just all of the JSON that they wanted to post to the server. Generates very high I/O writes for the user and it actually delays your startup next time because when we go to load your origin, we have to potentially load four and a half megabytes of data for you when you really only want a 100k of it.<br/>
    ... IndexedDB, which gets a lot of bad press. It is fully promise compatible now across all browsers. That was a problem for a while. It is no longer a problem. You can use promises and I recommend Jake Archibald's promised IndexedDB wrapper, it's a good one. It is fully asynchronous, it stores pretty much anything you want because we use the structured serialization API that postMessage uses. That means, like objects graphs, even if you have cycles in them or something like that, they will go to disk and they will come out of disk. It's also aware of blobs and files with some magic and I will get to that a little later. IndexedDB uses the quota storage cap which I'll also get to later as well.<br/>
    ... Last, we have the Cache API, which is technically part of these service workers spec. It is asynchronous and it's basically like a map for Fetch request and Response objects. Interestingly, it does implement the cache-vary header abstraction, so you can put in something that's JSON and you can put in something that's HTML and based on what you match for your request, we'll give you the correct thing based on all of the headers.<br/>
    ... It does not store POST requests at this point, like if you wanna cache your POST requests for submission later, we do not support doing that yet. There's actually some talk of augmenting IndexedDB to be able to store these requests and response objects so that you could do something like that or if you had a very clever eviction scheme in mind for your cache data. Right now, with the cache API, if you want to perform eviction, you either do something like, I think Google's Workbox team does which is, they use indexedDB to actually track how recent something is or there's a single API right now, Keys which lets you enumerate the entire contents of your cache and then you can manually evict things. It's not super efficient and in some cases, like I think in Chrome for a while, if you put too much data in your cache and then you called Keys, Chrome would crash or rather, your origin would crash.<br/>
    ... What's extra probably of interest to people here using Wasm, if you're dealing with responses, this is where the browser is able to do things like cache, the JS, AST caching, if we've derived something from it or for Wasm, if we've done additional compilation steps, we are able to tie it to the response. At least in Firefox, there's still ongoing optimization work here but it is like you're making it easier for the browser to help you if you're dealing with response objects.<br/>
    ... Okay so, I think structured serialization is not free, it's something we captured earlier today. Like postMessaging to a worker, it's not, like if you have a complex object graph, you're gonna pay for that because, we write it to a byte stream and then when it gets to the worker, we read it back out of the byte stream and create the objects. An issue we've had internally in Mozilla is, we actually have had people try and move something that was on the main thread API to a worker and they were surprised when it still took the exact same amount of time as it did before, 'cause what they were actually doing was doing IndexedDB from the main thread. The cost of using IndexedDB is the same on the worker and the main thread and it's also pretty much the same cost you're paying when you postMessage it.<br/>
    ... And this is something where it's hard for us and to improve on this, via the spec, especially because we actually need to invoke getters on any objects you might have for side effects and your getters are allowed to do crazy stuff like, mutate the object that we're serializing as you do it. Please avoid doing that because, we will possibly be able to optimize that more going forward if your object looks like a plain object.<br/>
    ... Related to this, IndexedDB allows you to create indices on your data and these indices are based on traversing your object graph for the same reasons that we need to, it's hard to optimize put an add in the first place for the structured serialization of your actual payload. It's expensive for us or it's at least, the cost is proportional to how many indices you have and how much of the your objects structure we need to traverse. It would be very interesting if there are ways we can help optimize this going forward, but again, it's a little bit hard per spec.<br/>
    ... But, there are things you can do to make postMessage less expensive and to make IndexedDB storage less expensive. Hopefully everyone is familiar with the fact that, on your Global's in JavaScript, we have blob and file. File is just a blob with a name attached to it. Blob can be constructed from other blobs, from strings, from ArrayBuffer stuff and basically, it creates an immutable handle on data that is now because it's a handle, we're dealing with things by reference instead of by value.<br/>
    ... So if you're postMessaging a four megabyte blob from the main thread to the worker, the cost for us is just to say, this pointer address and it's a blob. If you were to postMessage a four mega byte ArrayBuffer, if you're not transferring it, we have to actually write out all four megabytes of payload. So is a very handy thing to do, if you don't need to synchronous access to the data. With a blob, you still need to asynchronously get the data via either the FileReader API or the Fetch API or some other upcoming APIs.<br/>
    ... And also interestingly in a multi-process world, it's even better, because if you're dealing with blobs and they're going between processes and it's possible they will be further messaged around, we can lazily stream the data when it's actually needed. For example, if you have a service worker and you're responding with a blob, we don't actually consume the blob until the data get streamed, if it gets streamed.<br/>
    ... Also, if you put these into IndexedDB and you get them back out again at least on Firefox and I think on all the browsers, it ends up being disk-backed.<br/>
    ... One quick question I have about the previous presentation is, how much user losses are just due to the browser crashing? At some point, you can cause an out of memory event for your tab, or the browser or just the process you're in and it'll go away and that is especially possible on 32-bit platforms. Like on Windows, Firefox has seen this be a serious issue especially because, we have to allocate so much address space to video drivers or that, the video drivers need it. So if you put a blob in IndexedDB, pull it out, it's disk-backed and it's magically reference counted in the sense that, that blob is still valid even if you delete the object that's holding the blob from IndexedDB. You can keep using it and the browser will, assuming no bugs, cleanup all the disk usage for you when the time comes.<br/>
    ... All right, quota. There's basically two real APIs that expose the realities of how browsers manage quota for service workers, IndexedDB and the cache API. The first, is navigator.storage.estimate, and it tells you how much you're using and it tells you how much you're allowed to use before we'll throw exceptions. How much you're using can actually be somewhat of a lie. For privacy reasons, service workers are allowed to request data from third-party sites and because we don't want to allow side-channel attacks on extracting the actual size of the resources, we will lie about how big the resources are to you.<br/>
    ... So, if you use third-party resources and store them in the cache API, you can actually burn through your quota a little bit faster than you would expect. The big problem with quota is that, browsers don't really know what's the right amount of storage space for your site. So, speaking strictly for Firefox, we just guess, okay well, as the browser and we're probably the only browser the user uses, we're gonna take half of your free disk space and say that, that's for quota storage and we count any existing usage of browser storage as part of that and then we'll say, okay your group, which again is eTLD+1, so foo.example.com, bar.example.com, are all limited by the same group storage. We will give you 1/5th of 1/2 of the users free disk space up to two gigabytes.<br/>
    ... Just the fact that we're willing to let you use that storage, doesn't mean that it's necessarily a good idea because, we have eviction all right. At some point, Firefox says oh, I went over my limit for all of the storage for all of the origins and I should go evict that data and then, we just currently do a least recently used eviction.<br/>
    ... If you call navigator.storage.persist, we basically exempt you from that. We prompt the user and then your site is protected but it still doesn't fix the problem. So, buckets are the spec standard for eviction, we'll wipe out all of your site's data, if we wipe you out. So, the interesting stuff going forward spec-wise is, we would like to have multiple buckets, we would like you to be able to say, these are different pieces of data, this is the emails the user has composed are something that probably you would want to keep, like Gmail would want to keep drafts but things that are just cache could possibly be evicted.<br/>
    ... And there's really the big issue of how do we make this something that the user can understand? The background-fetch spec is a thing that's happening, being proposed that it let your app say, all right I'm gonna download like a 10 megabyte video, it's made up of these individual fetches and the browser will do that for you without your service worker needing to be active.<br/>
    ... It also interestingly expect to be exposed by the download manager and this is like the best hope I've seen for being able to explain to the user what's happening with storage. It's to say okay, well this is level one of this game, this is level two of this game and it would be my hope that we could also then, if we have these buckets, start with a more reasonable quota. So instead of saying, you get two gigabytes but spend it wisely, we could say, you get 100 megabytes and if you want more than that, you're gonna need to be able to explain to the user what these hunks of data are and then we will also be allowed to nuke them based on how recently you've used them.<br/>
    ... And then I guess, I'm out of time but there is a lot of interesting stuff happening now with third-party origins and iframes and I'll certainly be interested in discussing that with people because, at least, one of the things relative to the previous talk as well is that, if you're downloading resources from another site, as a third party origin, it's very likely that we will partition that data and any caching of the Wasm or something like that will not actually be cached and reused because, privacy reasons.</p>
