        <h4 id="item01">Interoperability/Reusability of high level WebAudio components</h4>

        <p class='phone'><cite>Michel:</cite> I'm from University of Nice <br>
        ... I'm the national coordinator of a big research project, dealing with musicians, composers <br>
        ... [Example of guitar music] <br>
        ... Everything here is done on the web <br>
        ... This was a guitar amplifier simulation, multi-track player <br>
        ... Everything is real-time <br>
        ... Some impressive WebAudio developments, synthesizers, vocoders, written in JavaScript or WASM <br>
        ... Building a Web Audio graph to process the sound <br>
        ... So far, no standard for reusing existing code, except for copy/paste or including a library <br>
        ... [Picture of a native DAW] <br>
        ... Four competing standards for plugins, complicated for developers to port <br>
        ... In early 2018, we started working on an open plugin standard for Web Audio <br>
        ... We wanted to bring native developers and low-level DSP developers <br>
        ... Some low level languages for DSP <br>
        ... We noticed that the existing standards are not web aware <br>
        ... Use URIs, dealing with async events, packaging, web components, JS modules <br>
        ... Guidelines for publishing and reusing components <br>
        ... Example of virtual pedal board for guitar effects <br>
        ... Some are coded in Faust, cross compiled to WASM <br>
        ... C++ synthesizers cross compiled to WASM <br>
        ... [Shows PedalBoard demo] <br>
        ... We designed a Web Audio plugin standard, using a toolchain for C and C++ <br>
        ... Extending to other languages such as MAX MSP, used by audio developers <br>
        ... For web aware distributing and packaging <br>
        ... Connect to your web audio graph <br>
        ... These are loaded on demand <br>
        ... It's easy to load then, here's Amped Studio, uses the same web component <br>
        ... Another commercial DAW managed to load our plugins in a few minutes <br>
        ... There's a Faust compiler, compiles to WASM, write and run DSP code, run directly in the browser <br>
        ... We embedded a GUI builder for creating components <br>
        ... Apply styling, then publish on a remote server <br>
        ... It generated a web component, with a page for loading and testing it <br>
        ... We'll automate this to publish on a public web server, provide documentation etc <br>
        ... Once published, you can try it in other hosts <br>
        ... The host scans remote repositories, can drag and drop plugins <br>
        ... [Demo of a synthesizer connected to a guitar amplifier] <br>
        ... You can plug in MIDI controllers and your electric guitar <br>
        ... We have a free SDK on GitHub <br>
        ... Unit tests to help developers test their plugins <br>
        ... We have developers, a first online IDE for making low level DSP algorithms in WASM <br>
        ... You can develop using classic web development tools <br>
        ... Can we make a Rocksmith game, like guitar hero but with a real guitar? <br>
        ... Yes, we have efficient effects, pitch detection <br>
        ... Problem with latency, recording live audio is OK on Mac OS, 12-23ms <br>
        ... Higher in Firefox, but should be the same <br>
        ... It's not playable on Windows, 81 to 100 ms <br>
        ... The Web Audio WG said there's a solution that should be shipped <br>
        ... You need the right OS level driver <br>
        ... The Web Audio API has an OutputLatency property, but not implemented yet <br>
        ... Some work is needed to make this more consistent <br>
        ... I work with online music schools, customers using Windows
        </p>

        <h4 id="item02">Porting Wwise to the web</h4>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Philippe:</cite> I'm a developer at Audiokinetic in Montreal <br>
        ... I'll talk about out attempt to make Wwise run on the web <br>
        ... The process of porting a big C++ game will be similar <br>
        ... Wwise is an authoring tool for Mac and Windows, used by sound designers to create game audio <br>
        ... Mixing, advanced effects, LPF, everything <br>
        ... It creates sound banks that need to be packaged with the game <br>
        ... There's an SDK that's integrated into the game, or via Unreal or Unity <br>
        ... This can read the sound banks and execute the audio in the game <br>
        ... If we want the web to become a major gaming platform, middleware is important <br>
        ... We have indie and AAA games launching with Wwise <br>
        ... Wwise is popular because it's cross platform, we support mobile OSs to high powered consoles and PCs, VR <br>
        ... The web can become another major gaming platform, we want to help get there <br>
        ... Getting stared, just make a sound, C++ code, port to the Web <br>
        ... Started with a Linux port, Emscripten provides a POSIX environment <br>
        ... WASM is an architecture that's neither x86 or ARM, some of our code paths rely on those <br>
        ... SSE emulation for SIMD, we couldn't get working <br>
        ... Wwise has an abstraction layer for atomics. We used some compiler intrinsics that produced linker errors <br>
        ... We replaced with Enscripten specific functions <br>
        ... pthreads, used workers instead, by far our biggest blocker <br>
        ... First attempt resulted in lots of deadlocks <br>
        ... An event manager thread that reads game events from a queue, updates game state, produces audio samples into a ring buffer <br>
        ... The thread can be woken up in many ways. Usually there's a separate audio thread that works differently on every platform <br>
        ... Takes the audio data and copies it to the hardware <br>
        ... It's a heartbeat for the system, keeps it alive <br>
        ... It was problematic for Emscripten, as that was based on the old ScriptProcessorNode in Web Audio, so on the same thread <br>
        ... The Wwise SDK comes with some blocking API calls for loading/unloading bank files <br>
        ... This was an exercise to see how much friction C++ developers will encounter when porting to the web <br>
        ... It was important to do better than that <br>
        ... We ended up disabling threading, do all on the main thread, to avoid deadlocks <br>
        ... Makes it impossible for the game to run, can't do advanced effects <br>
        ... Second attempt, replace SDL dependency with something based on Web Audio API and AudioWorklet <br>
        ... Worklet is separate from the main application. How to share the ring buffer with the processor program? <br>
        ... We looked at how emscripten does it for pthreads. We saw their worker imports the main app module <br>
        ... The app module detects which environment it's in <br>
        ... From our processor program, we imported the main game module, didn't work <br>
        ... The main JS file used APIs not supported in the audio worklet global scope, but took a long time to figure out due to lack of error information <br>
        ... If we compile as a self contained ES6 module, AudioWorklet can imported it <br>
        ... But, the worker global scope doesn't support importing ES6 module <br>
        ... We ended up with initialising the processor program using postMessage, with pointers to the audio buffers <br>
        ... This works as long as the WASM heap doesn't change during execution <br>
        ... We were able to reenable threading. It works <br>
        ... AudioWorklet is an improvement over ScriptProcessorNode <br>
        ... Threading is difficult to get right. The pthread is so different, it's hard to get working <br>
        ... Debugging was difficult, hard to get source maps <br>
        ... Could have done more if we'd had access to a proper debugger <br>
        ... We wish there were a lower level API for controlling number of samples per frame, channel interleaving, final channel downmix <br>
        ... Not possible with AudioWorklet, but could be optimised <br>
        ... SharedArrayBuffer - we need this, if you want C++ games to run on the web, need to fix this. If there's no threading, there's no AAA games on the web <br>
        ... Excited to hear Mozilla has a solution coming, what about Safari, mobile browsers? <br>
        ... We want to support the web platform, not just Chrome. Don't want to go back to "works on browser X"

        <h4 id="item03">Audio Device Client, Better and faster audio I/O on the web</h4>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Hongchan:</cite> I'm a spec editor for the Web Audio API <br>
        ... ADC is a proposal, working on the design in the CG <br>
        ... Want to collect feedback from industry experts <br>
        ... ADC offers low level I/O, better access to the audio hardware, a dedicated scope that runs on a real time priority thread <br>
        ... Why have a new API for audio? <br>
        ... We want to close the app gap for audio <br>
        ... All native platforms have low level audio APIs. What do we have on the web? <br>
        ... Does Web Audio serve as a low level audio API? <br>
        ... We're getting to a v1 Recommendation now <br>
        ... When it was reviewed by TAG in 2013, feedback was around lack of extensibility <br>
        ... You can't extend an AudioNode, also ScriptProcessorNode was broken <br>
        ... So we came up with AudioWorklet, where you can write JS code for custom audio processing <br>
        ... The most crucial improvement, we have isolation of audio processing code from the main JS thread <br>
        ... Now seeing exciting things on the web, can easily use WASM code as well <br>
        ... Developers now asking how to port to AudioWorklet <br>
        ... Put WASM code into AudioWorklet and AudioWorkletNode <br>
        ... This is a building block, part of the audio graph <br>
        ... The limitation of the Web Audio API still applies, the render buffer size is 128 sample frames, less than 3ms at 44.1kHz <br>
        ... Sensible for small building blocks like oscillators or filters, but not for an entire application such as a DAW <br>
        ... Audio developers take advantage of AudioWorklet, SharedArrayBuffer, and ? <br>
        ... The AudioWorklet is limited to 128 sample frames, so want to use Worker, can set up your own rendering, use the AW as an audio callback, and use a SAB <br>
        ... The audio thread is higher priority, but the worker thread is low priority <br>
        ... ADC is supposed to be the lowest layer, no redundant overhead, perfect for a WASM approach <br>
        ... Gives you better access to hardware without affecting user privacy, free from Audio API limitations of fixed buffer size <br>
        ... Layering of Web Audio on top of ADC <br>
        ... We'll push for the idea of a real time priority thread for JS audio processing <br>
        ... Game engines can take advantage of ADC for their audio code <br>
        ... Unlocks many new large scale applications for audio <br>
        ... You can configure hardware related properties, hardware delay, head mounted devices <br>
        ... Also useful if you have custom WASM decoder for teleconferencing app <br>
        ... Here's how to set up constraints (using capability an constraint pattern) <br>
        ... You can set up sample rate, channel count, callback buffer size <br>
        ... Pass to the capability function <br>
        ... use addModule() to launch your processing code <br>
        ... You can import an ES6 module, use it to process input and output buffers, from the audio hardware <br>
        ... You can register your processing function, using setDeviceCallback() <br>
        ... Core design issues discussed in the CG now, we want to discuss integration plans with WASM, Web Audio, WebRTC <br>
        ... I talked with Chrome security team. Real-time thread doesn't introduce a problem <br>
        ... Enabled via a flag in Chrome, want to collect feedback <br>
        ... Initial feedback from testing is positive <br>
        ... Mitigate by only allowing ADC to be enabled from a top level document <br>

        <cite>Kelvin:</cite> that matches our own experience! <br>
        ... we want to share some of the ideas we have to improve the situation <br>
        ... Initially we tried to get our whole UI done through the Web layer - but the UI is controlled via a gamepad, and it turned out the gamepad API limitations prevented us from going that way <br>
        ... when we realized that, we worked with other teams and consoles to see if there was interest in fixing this <br>
        ... on the other side, we heard from the gamepad api creators that there wasn't enough demand to bring changes / momentum to the API <br>
        ... we concluded we needed to help with the spec <br>
        ... the Gamepad API in 2014 provided some basic gamepad functionality <br>
        ... nothing has chanced since then <br>
        ... it is still a WD, never made it to CR <br>
        ... as we surveyed the group of users, we heard interest in the following changes: <br>
        ... - standardize gamepad inputs <br>
        ... there is variation both across controllers AND across browsers <br>
        ... which makes it very complicated to use it <br>
        ... - support for modern controller features, e.G. touch surfaces, light indicators, haptics, accelerometer, gyroscope <br>
        ... We divided our work into 2 work streams: v1 is about finishing the current gamepad spec by bringing to Rec after bringing clarfiications and fixing privacy &amp; security aspects

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Matthew:</cite> from an accessibility perspective, we would need button remapping, or use 2 controllers instead of 1 for ease of usage <br>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Kelvin:</cite> we looked at this at the product level, but haven't addressed this at the API level <br>

        <cite>Matthew:</cite> ideally, we wouldn't have to ask the game developers to have to deal with it, but be managed transparently

        <cite>Nell:</cite> a quick update on where WebXR is heading on this <br>
        ... we have the notion of input source <br>
        ... which can be a hand, a controller, etc <br>
        ... we distinguish tracked and untracked input sources <br>
        ... we expose the gamepad API as part of this input source <br>
        ... one challenge is that VR controllers have a lot more diversity in their form factors <br>
        ... we've converged toward a shared model with a hierarchy of interaction profiles, from most to least specific to enable fallback <br>
        ... the InputSource object has a selectstart and selectend event <br>
        ... we have an open issue about whether other buttons should trigger events - want to collaborate with the gamepad crew <br>
        ... we're also building a registry of controller inputs
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Kelvin:</cite> how dependent are you on the gamepad API?
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Nell:</cite> we're using the interface and exposing it in the InputSource object - not as navigator.gamepads <br>
        ... the way we structured it, we knew about changes coming to the gamepad API <br>
        ... we can add additional properties to the InputSource as the gamepad API evolve and requires it

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Kelvin:</cite> our controllers tend to be poll-based - how will you manage that?
        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Nell:</cite> data on controllers need to be bound to the particular pose of the player and its devices - sync is key <br>
        ... so we need to align to an event model, and ask the UA to deal with polling to keep the event loop aligned with the display framerate

        </p>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Navid:</cite> I'm part of the Chromium input dev team <br>
        ... we're looking at making user interaction as smooth as possible, bringing new capabilities, and reducing developer pain points <br>
        ... Today, I'll focus on latency of input but touch a bit on the 2 other aspects <br>
        ... there are lots of sources of latency <br>
        ... some come from how developers write their code e.g. long running tasks <br>
        ... some come from how browsers work - either for architectural reasons, some for security or privacy reasons <br>
        ... To help with developers-induced latency, we have guidelines on how to avoid these problems - e.g. requestIdleCallback, workers, or the new proposal isInputPending <br>
        ... But I'm particularly interested in browser-induced latency <br>
        ... for instance, browsers suppress touch events if you do screen touch in a small region (called slop region) because they need to detect whether this is a gesture or a scroll <br>
        ... there are efforts to align user inputs with requestAnimationFrame <br>
        ... efforts to move processing off the main thread eg. with worklets <br>
        ... One source of latency is having workers and worklets but not having access to input events <br>
        ... Workers have a very limited API surface <br>
        ... you can delegate work off the main thread with workers and worklets <br>
        ... but there is still the bottleneck that all the input still goes through the main thread <br>
        ... Some animations aren't based on user input (e.g. time-based animations or scrolling) - I'll focus on those that depend on user input <br>
        ... A few use cases: purely local gaming with offloading off the main thread, network-based streaming of games <br>
        ... low-latency drawing, taking advantage of the offscreen canvas API that helps with rendering <br>
        ... low-latency interactive audio - e.g. when playing audio based on user input <br>
        ... or interactive animations based on user input <br>
        ... [showing video] <br>
        ... our goal is that when the main thread is under pressure, user input in a separate worker would still keep good performance <br>
        ... so we want to duplicate or mirror user input into separate workers <br>
        ... we have a proposed API - it focus on user input that are limited to a given target <br>
        ... in that case, we could delegate events of a specific target to a separate worker <br>
        ... with that approach, we can completely avoid blokcing the main thread thanks to the usage of the compositor <br>
        ... as a result, we can push events to the network at no cost <br>
        ... it's fully polyfillable from a functionality perspective (but of course not from a performance perspective) <br>
        ... we are at the early stages of the design - we have an explainer on which we would like to get feedback <br>
        ... we already had one question about gamepad - we may have to deal with it differently <br>
        ... please get in touch if you're interested <br>
        ... This was one of the topic - input on workers <br>
        ... The other one is non-rAF aligned events <br>
        ... today, browsers delay events until requestAnimationFrame - the assumption is that events only matter when display get updated <br>
        ... as an optimization <br>
        ... some apps may be sensitive to the more precise timeline, e.g. when shipping events to the network <br>
        ... this has lead to this notion of high frequency update - available behind a flag in Chrome <br>
        ... it's a potential performance footgun - we're using different event names to make clear of its potential impact <br>
        ... I'm happy to hear about more sources of potential latency latency

        <h4 id="item07">WebCodecs &amp; WebTransport</h4>

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Peter:</cite> I work at Google on Chrome and have been involved in WebRTC <br>
        ... want to talk about WebCodecs &amp; WebTransport that can help with cloud gaming <br>
        ... 1st issue is that WebRTC is not a great fit for cloud gaming (although it can be used) <br>
        ... likelwise, MSE is not great for cloud gaming <br>
        ... Web sockets or RTC Data channels aren't a good fit either <br>
        ... this has led to the design of these 2 new primitives I'll present <br>
        ... you can think of WebRTC and MSE has two high-level APIs well suited for their use cases <br>
        ... for cloud gaming, these high level APIs aren't goo enough of a fit; we could look at a dedicated cloud gaming API, but we thought going at low level APIs that would serve the purpose <br>
        ... we've seen lots of feedback that a UDP-like API for client-server would go a long way <br>
        ... Likewise, getting MSE to fulfill always-more-advanced codecs needs is going to be difficult <br>
        ... this leads to the notion of looking at WebCodecs and WebTransports - similar to some of the primitives in OS (e.g. android) <br>
        ... no particular challenge for Codecs <br>
        ... for UDP, there are security challenges <br>
        ... but QUIC to the rescue - QUIC is a new protocol that gives security, low latency congestion control, reliable and unreliable transport, serves as a basis of http3 and has already good library support <br>
        ... It benefits games: faster loading, and more network resilient <br>
        ... In the context of cloud gaming, HTTP3 is too high level - that's where Web Transport comes into play <br>
        ... Streaming today can be done: <br>
        ... - with WebRTC (ICE, DTLS, SRTP) - all the depacketizing/buffering/decoding/rendering is done entirely by the browser <br>
        ... that makes it hard to use in a number of contexts and is limited by RTP <br>
        ... one work around is to transmit it via the RTC data channel <br>
        ... it remains hard to use in a client-server architecture, is not consistent across browsers <br>
        ... Another approach is to use WASM to deal with the encoding and decoding, and transmit over WebSocket <br>
        ... that's not ideal from a battery/CPU perspective - no access to hardware encoder/decoder <br>
        ... We can do better <br>
        ... WebTransport is based on QUIC, combines the advantages of datachannels and websockets with other benefits <br>
        ... including ease of use in client/server architecture, with pluggable congestion control and a better API <br>
        ... likewise, for codecs, with WebCodecs we can expose the features implicitly provided by MSE and WebRTC and expose them to the Web in a Web friendly way <br>
        ... WebTransport is in origin-trial - we're looking for customers <br>
        ... WebCodecs is less advanced - want to find interested parties to prioritize the work <br>
        ... We're looking for customers and want to learn more about applicable use cases, and constraints of their use <br>
        ... this isn't just applicable to Cloud Gaming, but applicable to gaming more broadly: low latency game state push, low latency game assets streaming, in-game comms, low-latency server-based machine learning, transcoding <br>
        ... get new codecs support faster without waiting for browser implementations

        ... In French, gender-inclusive nouns have been created <br>
        ... a more popular solution from what I see online <br>
        ... is people add an agenda ending between two full stops <br>
        ... such as cher.e.s ami.e.s <br>
        ... In German you can use an asterisk <br>
        ... In Russian, it becomes more complicated <br>
        ... we have three genders: masculine, feminine and neutral <br>
        ... it is challenging to work around <br>
        ... linguists typically use second person plural <br>
        ... If I translate the sentence, 'yesterday I found a nice cake recipe' <br>
        ... it is difficult to translate into Russian in a neutral way <br>
        ... professional names may refer to women <br>
        ... but in Russian it would only be masculine or feminine

        <p class='phone'>
        <cite>Gabriel:</cite> In Spanish, masculine refers to groups <br>
        ... the characters cannot be pronounced or reproduced in text to speech which is problematic for people with disabilities <br>
        ... In LGBT in Italian it is common use to replace the a and o in some words <br>
        ... I have not seen this much in common language, but it is used in LBGT and hopefully its usage will expand <br>
        ... Like Spanish there is the possibility to use @ to indicate plural <br>
        ... but if it's used for every word, the text would be full of symbols

        <cite>Francois:</cite> Different types of groups at W3C.<br>
        ... CGs are open to all, for preliminary technical work <br>

        ... IG are for W3C members, set roadmaps for a technology space (Media &amp; Entertainment, Payments)<br>
        ... Could we have a Games IG? <br>
        ... Actual standardisation happens in WGs, strong royalty free policy <br>
        ... We'll review the topics from the workshop. Options:<br>
        ... 1. do nothing, if we don't have the right people, or if it's already covered <br>
        ... 2. want to refine scope, could happen in a BG or IG to look at use cases and requirements <br>
        ... 3. For an understood technical problem, incubate in a CG, new or existing <br>
        ... 4. when there's a solution with some support, move to standardisation, charter a WG <br>
        ... Who's willing to support, drive the work, participate? <br>
        ... First topic: Threading, e.g., PromiseTask proposal, sharing objects between threads, worker creation that takes a function

        <cite>Francois:</cite> That makes us jump directly to the last thing I wanted to cover<br>
        ... What do we do next with games per se? Do we want to create a community around game for use cases and requirements at W3C?<br>
        ... There's an inactive games CG, we could make a games IG, if people are willing to participate <br>
        ... That could be a natural home for writing such proposals, then take to WHATWG, TC39, W3C, etc.<br>
        ... Show of interest in a games activity at W3C? <br>
        ... [20 or so] <br>
        ... That's a good score. Interesting. I'll reach out to you after the workshop to evaluate that possibility then.<br>

        ... DWARF: Please contribute to the CG <br>
        ... Garbage collection? <br>
