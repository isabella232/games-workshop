    <section>
      <p>W3C is organizing a workshop to look at the intersection of Web and games. The workshop aims at bringing together browser vendors, game engines developers, games developers, game distributors, and device manufacturers to assess the readiness of the Open Web Platform for games, at understanding how games can leverage the power of the Web as a social platform for discovery and sharing, enabling the sharing of experiences between practitioners in these and related fields, at identifying business constraints and technical gaps for distributing games on the Web, and at evaluating the opportunities for standardization of APIs and formats that would ease the development of games on the Web.</p>

      <p>For more details on the conference, see the <a href="./">Web Games Workshop page</a>.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring W3C Workshop on Web Games shows leadership and helps move the dialog forward.</p>

        <h3 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h3>
        <p>The cost to hold a workshop includes costs for venue (including setup and custodial costs), AV requirements (optionally including recording), catering (lunch and breaks), materials, travel and staffing, and other considerations.</p>

        <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.</p>

        <p>If you see value in discussing possible standardization of Web technologies for games, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution of the Web.</p>

        <p>The more sponsorships we get, the better the amenities will be, including options like recording and transcription for spreading and preserving what was discussed, T-shirts for attendees, and better meals.</p>

        <h3 id="sponsorship">Becoming a Sponsor</h3>
        <p>W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from industry, research, government, and the developer community.</p>
        <p>Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse international audience setting W3C&#39;s strategic direction, sponsorship helps your organization reach W3C&#39;s engaged participants.</p>
        <p>Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are subject to W3C approval.</p>
