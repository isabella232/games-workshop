UX and Web Games â€“ defining users and designers needs

The webs open nature means that it is an ideal platform for designers and academics to explore and research new interactions and new user experiences for web games. The use of web games can cross over multiple sectors including entertainment, education and health. What are the needs of the users in these different sectors? What should the user experience be like? What tools would help designers and researchers work with the web to advance the user experience in web games?

This topic will examine UX and web games from the point of view of the user and the designer, and bring insights from both groups. By presenting research and examples of both groups wants and needs the goal of this topic is to explore and analyse current UX and design tools in web games, then create actions for moving forward.
