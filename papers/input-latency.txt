I'm Chromium input dev <https://www.chromium.org/teams/input-dev> TL and
(co-)editor and collaborator on W3C input related specifications such
as Pointer Events <https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/> and Pointer Lock
<https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerlock/>. We are in the process of
standardizing a few APIs that will reduce the latency of input on the web
that we believed might be particularly useful for the gaming use cases. I
can present a bit on those APIs such as input for workers
<https://github.com/NavidZ/input-for-workers> or pointerrawupdate
<https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/extension.html#the-pointerrawupdate-event>
and lead some discussions around that.

My main goal is to talk to interested partners to work with them during the
standardization process and incorporate their feedback in both API design
and Chromium implementation and hopefully have them as our early adopters.

Cheers,
Navid
