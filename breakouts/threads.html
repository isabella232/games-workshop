<h1>Workshop on Web Game
<br/><span style="font-size: smaller">Breakout session on Threads</span></h1>
<h2>28 June 2019</h2>

<p><em>This breakout session was part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/12/games-workshop">Workshop on Web games</a>. Minutes taken by Dominique HazaÃ«l-Massieux.</em></p>

<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> got some ideas shared by
email after our discussion yesterday<br />
... initially, I thought that Web workers are painful to
start<br />
... the serialization/deserialization needed to communicate
among workers is also costly when you need to constantly share
info across threads<br />
... for instance, synchronizing scene graphs across workers is
costly<br />
... SharedArrayBuffer is useful but not enough<br />
... someone shared the idea of a Task concept which captures
and freezes a context<br />
... the task starts on a new thread and has read-only access to
the starting context<br />
... this would work very well for my scene graph case, physics,
or collision detection<br />
... more difficult for particles, but still probably
usable<br />
... this would solve quite a few problems</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>@@@:</cite> with a readonly context, you probably
need to have very light threads because you would likely need
to start many of them rapidly for a short time</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> there is a similar
approach in C# with a pool of threads that get recycled<br />
... very cheap to start</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> the worker in this model
would see a read-only view of the model<br />
... what about the main thread then?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Rafael:</cite> it would have to be
read-only</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> I think the main thread
should be kept out of the equation to simplify the model</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> what is the status of rAF
in workers?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> it works<br />
... I have rAF in a worker, OffscreenCanvas in a worker, soon
user input<br />
... the last thing I need is to be able to separate the work in
that thread</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> OffscreenCanvas still needs
to hands off its results to the main thread<br />
... this could be done here as well</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>@@@:</cite> you will still need some form of blocking
for read-only state management, so we need to keep this
thread-spawning off the main thread</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>david:</cite> that's what the proposal
is indeed</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Navid:</cite> I believe there is work
under way to use OffscreenCanvas without interfering with the
main thread at all<br />
... workers don't have access to the DOM currently; there is a
project to enable DOM-splitting with some defined CSS property
to indicate that a part of the DOM needs to be composited
differently<br />
... similar to cross- vs same-origin iframes<br />
... this would allow to hand off part of the DOM to a specific
worker<br />
... this would enable to render different part of the pages at
different frame rates</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ricardo:</cite> OffscreenCanvas has
indeed that feature with "transferControl"</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> the constraint right now
is how workers get started<br />
... to start a worker, I have to re-import all my libraries in
a worker<br />
... it would be great to be able to spawn a worker with the
same set of loaded libraries<br />
... (not mentioning that all of these need to be managed as
different files, which isn't good wrt webpack-ing)</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> let's say there was way to
tell this function runs into a separate worker<br />
... how does this work with the global scope?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> Jonas Sicking looked into
this a few years ago; it's pretty difficult, would need to
convince quite a few people<br />
... we had a separate project called parallel JS that
investigated this, was presented to TC39 but not well received
and created challenges in implementations<br />
... the closest thing was "FunctionPromise" (?)<br />
... which made it easy to create cheap-to-instantiate
string-defined functions that could be transfered to a
worker</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> I could see that working,
but that leaves the problem of imported scripts - we would need
an API to include these in the pack</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>@@@:</cite> how would that work with the various
optimization processes?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> there would be
opportunities for sharing machine code across these threads</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> the lack of multithreading
in JS is unique in the world of programming languages</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> one fundamental difference
is that this prevents multi-thread race crashes</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ryan:</cite> being able to cache
pre-compiled or JITed code would be useful for game engines</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Andrew:</cite> the one hope for that is
the cache API with ServiceWorker - cloned copies of responses
can make use of pre-JITed code</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dom:</cite> is that feature of the Cache
API a well-known aspect?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Andrew:</cite> not sure - there will
probably be an info box in the spec<br />
... in any case, it won't be a guaranteed behavior<br />
... we would also want to avoid heuristics being abused</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> parsed-but-not-instianted
code I was alluding to is what WASM provide</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ryan:</cite> that's interesting, but
will we lose this ability in JS?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> +1 - let's not make JS a
poor child of the Web<br />
... let's make sure all these new cool features remain
available to JS devs</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dave:</cite> from our experience,
running WASM on low-end android is impossible from a
performance perspective<br />
... because the code is too big</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Nick_Hulu:</cite> embedded devices,
low-end devices don't have access to JIT; it would be great to
be able to parallelize<br />
... threads would be our only way to keep performance in this
constrained environment</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ryan:</cite> there are more or more use
cases that don't have JIT<br />
... e.g. in cars</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> I hear consensus on the
user-side - threading is needed<br />
... but I hear lots of frinction from browser devs</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Andrew:</cite> you mentioned there was 2
separate execution environments which creates deployment
challenges<br />
... do ES6 module help?<br />
... it doesn't solve all the packaging issues</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> the challenge is as a
framework developer, asking my users to deal with that
complexity is something I would prefer avoid<br />
... I also can't tell which modules my users have imported
before I start a new worker</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ryan:</cite> I'm curious about this
duplicate concept - what would that cover?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> just the code</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>@@@:</cite> but what about e.g. dynamically generated
functions?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dave:</cite> this can be solved by a
nice import function</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> but that still creates
complexity</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> do you have a helper
library that deals with this importing? how do you manage
it?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> right now I have to
manually import the scripts, finding the right paths<br />
... I have to create a URL object to manage my workers</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Myles:</cite> maybe we should start by
optimizing your current approach instead of doing a broader
redesign</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dave:</cite> the issues that were
summarized yesterday: the split file issue is one (but there is
a workaround), shared memory will be helped by
SharedArrayBuffer but doesn't solve the cases where you need
object that get serialized/deserialized<br />
... not sure how your read-only model would help with e.g.
Physics Engine</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> a challenge with JS objects
is that they're very complex<br />
... there is a proposal for a TypedObject in JS that may help -
it brings an immutable structure<br />
... part of the idea would be be able to mark them as shareable
- in which case they can only point at shareable objects<br />
... this could help with multi-threading<br />
... this would also help with gc-support in WASM<br />
... TypedObject would be the reflection of gc-objects</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dom:</cite> this is in TC 39?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> yes, at Stage 0 (there is
an explainer)</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Andrew:</cite> would it have similar
shared semantics as sharedarraybuffer?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> roughly</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ryan:</cite> what are structural
limitations?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> it has a weak memory
model</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Rafael:</cite> even in a mono thread
this would go a long way to help with David's problem</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> it would indeed solve some
(but not all) use cases</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dom:</cite> in summary?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>David:</cite> worker initiialization and
scripts imports could be simplified<br />
... TypedObject provide nice opportunities for memory
management for Games</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Nick:</cite> I liked Luke's idea about
cached-JITed code</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> see FunctionPromise in TC
39</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>@@@_King:</cite> coming from a C++ background - will
emscripten manage this directly?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Luke:</cite> WASM takes care of it</p>
