<h1>Workshop on Web Game
<br/><span style="font-size: smaller">Breakout session on WebAssembly</span></h1>
<h2>28 June 2019</h2>

<p><em>This breakout session was part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/12/games-workshop">Workshop on Web games</a>. Notes taken by Mathias Westerdahl.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Suggestion to create new APIs with wasm in mind
    <ul>
      <li>be mindful with object creation</li>
      <li>suggest more C style functions like "generateData(view)" and it creates into that preallocated buffer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Discussed memory mapping in WASM
    <ul>
      <li>nothing going on in this area just yet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Discussion about deobfuscation and protecting assets
    <ul>
      <li>WASM doesn't add any protection here</li>
      <li>We talked about WebCrypto to protect assets, which might be something for game developers</li>
      <li>Also loading some "runtime key" to avoid "simple ripping off a game"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Are there any resources for "regular" web developers to start using WASM?
    <ul>
      <li>going from "C" to WASM is easier</li>
      <li>coming from JS to WASM is harder to understand</li>
      <li>Rust -> WASM is an example of one way to go, perhaps interesting for JS too</li>
      <li>Luke mentioned AssemblyScript for writing WASM close code</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Exception handling coming in WASM</li>

  <li>Discussion about SharedArrayBuffer and atomics
    <ul>
      <li>is there feature detection for this?</li>
      <li>there is some, will likely change in the future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Loading time/efficiency discussion
    <ul>
      <li>Where is WASM currently in regards to loading shared libraries?</li>
      <li>Recent changes pave the way for load time dynamic linking (ES6 module imports)</li>
      <li>How to do cross origin sharing?</li>
      <li>Can save loading time on game portals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Discussion about caching
    <ul>
      <li>Luke mentioned a new suggested function "cache tput"</li>
      <li>Talked about caching into subdomain buckets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Is there a difference in cost going from JS <-> WASM?</li>
  <li>Luke mentions a blog post with some performance numbers</li>
</ul>
