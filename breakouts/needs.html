      <h2>Mapping games users and designers needs to technologies</h2>

<p><em>This workshop session was part of the <a href="../report.html">Workshop on Web games</a>. Report written by Indira Knight.</em></p>

<section>
  <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
  <p>The “mapping games users and designers needs to technologies” workshop was designed to get participants to think about specific users needs and how they could be fulfilled with web games technologies. The user groups were touch/haptics researchers, UX designers, gamers, hardware developers and serious games designers(educational and therapeutic applications), all groups who could be using web game technologies. The outputs of the workshop are a matrix, and series of speculative design ideas. The matrix shows the user groups and ideas that could help them. The speculative design looked at how these groups could be using the web in the future, and what would need to be implemented for this to happen.</p>

  <p>Themes have been identified from the outputs of the workshop. One of the biggest themes was around APIs with suggestions for new APIs or extending existing ones for example the Gamepad API. Social/collaborative was another large theme with suggestions such as creating an open source social graph, permission based access for friends and a proximity API. Other themes include metadata, standards, latency, documentation and UI.</p>

  <p>The speculative design ideas are varied but there were a few that would give the user more agency. For example being able to easily disconnect from touch, and having an open source natural language processing. There were also ideas around having 3D model texture and temperature as material properties, native support for 3D in the browser, and expanding the access to instrumentation and tooling for performing UX studies in the browser. The documents produced from this workshop can be analysed further to find practical solutions that fulfil these user groups needs.</p>

<section>
  <h3 id="workshop">The Workshop</h3>
  <p>The workshop was run in three groups and had two parts. The first part was to create the matrix. This was done by giving participants 2 minutes per user group to solo brainstorm solutions for that user. For the second part of the workshop, participants chose which user group they wanted to work on and in groups discussed how that user would be using the web in 3 years time. They thought about the use but also what would need to be in place to get there. There was time at the end of the workshop to feedback their groups solutions to the whole group.</p>

  <p>The analysis of the workshop is in three sections. Section one is the speculation on future uses. The second section is the thematic analysis of the solo brainstorming of users needs to technologies. The third section is a matrix of the solo brainstorming.</p>

  <h3 id="speculation">Speculation on future uses</h3>
  <p>This was the final part of the workshop, participants chose which user group they wanted to work on and those groups discussed how the user would be using the web in 3 years time. They thought about the use but also what would need to be in place to get there.</p>

  <section>
    <h4 id="touch">Touch/Haptics</h4>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <p>Thought about full body haptics and the need for parental/safety controls. There could be an API for this, so you could choose a body part and send a signal to describe the touch. There should be a kill switch, so the person can abort the touch, disconnect from it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <p>Higher level APIs (3D model tog) 3D model texture and temperature as material properties. WebXR extensions, VR controller gloves vibrate at positions, could heat up if hardware supported it. Vibration vest - like audio channel? Custom hardware of hid (usb/bluetooth)</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="ux">UX design</h4>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <p>Web XR is like the early days of mobile web, it was initially hard to prototype for the mobile web, there needs to be a sketch for the VR experience. There needs to be a way to edit in AR and VR, drag and drop, tooling will need to change. There needs to be a polyfill approach to explore different ideas, then turn that into solid tooling</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Stylus/touch/voice interface - natural behaviours -> digital objects</li>
        <li>Native support for 3D in the browser</li>
        <li>Visual programming king/libraries for creation, easy (non-programmers), consistent across platforms</li>
        <li>Open source library of objects/pre-fabs</li>
        <li>Visual “language” for creating/assigning behaviours</li>
        <li>Common/central repository - github equivalent + standards</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <p>Future Designer Needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Near future: Expanding Speech APIs to include the ability to give the browser commands.  This would give the Designer the ability to quickly map phrases to actions in a game.</li>
        <li>Near future: Expanding the access to instrumentation and tooling for performing UX studies in the browser.  Designers need the ability to capture and analyze massive amounts of input data while a player tests a game.  This would require the browser to expand the permission model for accessing and storing data that could fingerprint a user. This would need to be behind a launch flag or something that a user would have to take direct action to turn on. Tooling should include eye tracking via the webcam, cursor tracking, touch tracking, game pad input tracking, etc etc.</li>
        <li>Somewhere between now and the near future: Give designers the ability to prototype and test new interfaces via a declarative interaction model similar to A-Frame. The UX designer would be able to declare which objects are interactive and which aren’t. Declare if an object can be grabbed, touched, picked up, static, etc etc. (This led to a discussion about the SMIL 3.0 spec and how we could borrow from it)</li>
        <li>New future: Rethink text inputs and standardize mobile inputs in web games.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="gamers">Gamers</h4>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <p>There is already the technology available for the wants of the gamers. The gamers want better content so there needs to be incentives to build better games.</p>

      <p>The strength of the web is that is is a good place for a social experience. At the moment social graphs are proprietary (e.g. Facebook). For web games there would need to be an open source social graph for gamers to be able to play with friends.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Webassembly - bridging the gap to streaming “cloud gaming”</li>
        <li>Open XR - breaking walls down between traditional gaming “20” “side scroller” “30” “VR”, could be the same game with different forms of deployment</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="hardware">Hardware developer</h4>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>
      <p>Need low level access exposed in the browser and device level interfaces. It would be good to have a standard so different devices can be linked, so people using a hololens can interact with people using a phone. A way of mapping values between devices</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="serious">Serious games (educational, therapies and treatments)</h4>

    <section>
      <h5>Idea</h5>

      <p>Be able to get virtual hugs in the future or have adaptive early learning tools. The developer community and the public should be made more aware of this area and the potential for development in this area. There needs to be machine learning API’s, Open speak API’s (natural language processing NLP). Currently NLP is controlled by big companies such as Google or Microsoft, there is space for an open version that can be easily used in web projects</p>
    </section>
  </section>

<section>
  <h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
  <p>While putting ideas from the brainstorming into the matrix themes started to appear. There is a short write up of some of these themes below, followed by a full list of themes. Some of the ideas overlap between themes, so they have been added were they are more specific.</p>

  <section>
    <h4 id="haptics">Haptics</h4>
    <p>One of the main themes for haptics was having a standard format for the different touch experiences from the hardware, so there can be standards for remapping touch. Another theme was around meta data  for example 3D file formats could include data about how haptics should feel for an object, and also a data format or schema for consensual interactions.</p>
    <p>There were a lot of suggestions for haptics API’s, either looking to extend existing API’s such at the Gamepad API or WebXR or creating a new haptics API, or a generic sensor API that can be used for rapid prototyping with pressure, vibration etc.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="social">Social and collaborative games</h4>
    <p>There were thoughts on how gamers could play with friends, a couple of the suggestions were an open source social graph or accessing phone contacts go make social gaming possible without the need for interaction with social network.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="machinelearning">Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>There were a lot of suggestions on API’s, there are a couple of larger sub themes in the API theme which are connected , a machine learning API and a speech API, which could include machine learning.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="networks">Networks</h4>
    <p>Peer to Peer and WebRTC mentioned a few times. Frictionless login/single sign on across browsers/devices also mentioned.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
    <p>There were some ideas around testing including creating unique URLs for each game level/location(for quick debugging. It was suggested that web game platforms would have to provide more QA to ensure quality.</p>
